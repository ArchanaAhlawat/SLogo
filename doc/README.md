## Authors:


Frontend: Owen (turtle movement, updates) and YiQin (layout, overall flow (controller))


Backend: Archana (parser, some instructions) and Kelly (instructions and associated hierarchy, some parser work)


Start Date: 10/5


End Date: 10/31


Hours Worked: around 55 hours per person with around 20 hours for the basic and 35 for the extension. We also dreamed (had nightmares about interfaces?) about this...


MAIN: is in frontenddriver


Bugs:

* active/deactive turtles isn't perfect with the turtle movements still being made on deactive turtles and being shown at the end when they are activated

* the turtle isn't limited to the gridpane on the frontend and runs off and onto other parts of the screen

* the backend stamps and shape commands aren't really implemented due to ambiguity

* complex commands with more [[]] nested brackets have some issues


Impressions:

* project was super fun on the backend, but some consistency would be nice (the commands on the websites are different from the commands in the resource files...)
